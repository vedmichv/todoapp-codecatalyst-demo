## Demo application overview

This project is a "To Do" single-page application.  It is meant to be extensible after creation to meet your team's requirements.



### Architecture overview

![App overview](./readme-img/build-app-1.png)

This project is composed of 2 main components: 
* the Backend that expose a REST CRUD API to manage ToDo items
* the Frontend that expose a Web Interface interacting with the REST API

### Backend

The ToDo backend is deployed as a RESTful API using AWS Serverless technologies:
- [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway) to provide the REST interface to the persistence layer
- [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb) for list persistence
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda) provides the glue between the two.

The [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk) provides the infrastructure-as-code used to deploy to a live AWS environment.  You can find all of the above under the '/backend' folder in the CodeCatalyst repository.

The code in the `backend` folder includes unit test cases that can be run using your development environment.  All code artifacts in the backend folder can be extended to meet your needs.

Deployment instruction can be found in the [backend/README.md](./backend/README.md) file.

### Frontend

The frontend application is based on [ReactJS 17](https://reactjs.org) and TypeScript. The user interface uses [CloudScape](https://cloudscape.design) components and stylesheets.

The frontend is built and deployed using AWS CDK.  The deployment includes Amazon S3+CloudFront

The build pipeline runs unit and integration tests on the frontend and backend, and produces testing reports.  Failed tests will stop the artifacts from publishing.  Front end code is compiled and optimized for production deployment. The [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront) content delivery network is used to pull both the frontend and backend together under a single logical internet-accessible domain under the AWS account that is connected.  Amazon Cloudfront provides HTTPS support for the domain as well as forward caching for the front-end.


Deployment instruction can be found in the [frontend/README.md](./frontend/README.md) file.

2.4. Once AWS Builder is created, sign in to CodeCatalyst.

2.5. Provide **Alias**, **Space name**, **AWS account ID** and Click **Verify in the AWS console**.

2.6. Once AWS account is verified, Click **Create space**.

![Create Space](./readme-img/prereq-3.png)

3. Create a IAM role with required permissions for CodeCatalyst. For more information about the role and role policy, see [Creating a CodeCatalyst service role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/ipa-iam-roles.html) or follow the section below.

#### Connections and permissions

3.1. Open [AWS CodeCatalyst Console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/home?region=us-west-2#/) and select your space on the left pane.

3.2 Click **Add IAM role**.

![Create Space](./readme-img/prereq-4-iam.png)

- Choose the first option **Create CodeCatalyst Create CodeCatalyst development administrator role in IAM** and IAM role will be automatically created for you. Click **Create development role**.

- Alternatively you can select an existing IAM role by selecting "Add an existing IAM role" from the add IAM role options. The IAM role needs to contain the CodeCatalyst trust policy, as well as the following permissions:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudformation:*",
                "ssm:*",
                "s3:*",
                "iam:PassRole",
                "iam:GetRole",
                "iam:CreateRole",
                "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
                "iam:PutRolePolicy"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

The IAM roles also require the Amazon CodeCatalyst service principals `codecatalyst.amazonaws.com` and `codecatalyst-runner.amazonaws.com`.

Required IAM role trust policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": [
                    "codecatalyst.amazonaws.com",
                    "codecatalyst-runner.amazonaws.com"
                ]
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```
We are done with prerequistes and ready to start building!


## Step 1 - Code: Creating a To Do Web Application project.

1. In the [CodeCatalyst console]((https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/home?region=us-west-2#/)), navigate to the space where you want to create a project and click **Create project** button at the top.
2. Keep selection **Start with a blueprint** and choose *To Do web application*. You can use seach functionality to search blueprints by name. Click **Next**. 
3. Enter the **Project Name**: *todoapp-demo*, under **CDK Role** choose the IAM role you created in the Prerequisites section.
4. Expand **Frontend Options** and **Backend Options** and select *Python* in both sections. Click **Create Project**.

![Create Project](./readme-img/build-app-2.png)

## Step 2 - Initial Build & Deploy: CI/CD Workflow.

1. On the left pane expand **CI/CD** and click **Workflows**.
2. Under Recent runs, click on the run you initiated. It will take approximately 20 minutes to complete.You see green check marks next to each Action indicating completion. In the meantime, you can explore CI/CD defininition in YAML.
![Visual Workflow](./readme-img/build-app-3.png)

3. Once your application is deployed, go to **Variables** Tab and copy **AppURL**. Try to add items.
![Visual Workflow](./readme-img/build-app-4.png)

4. Add a couple of items and validate that your application is working
![To do app](./readme-img/build-app-5.png)

5. Open [AWS CloudFormation](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) and review resources that we created for your application. 
![CloudFormation Stacks](./readme-img/build-app-6.png) 

6. You can drill down to all the resources by selecting a stack.
![CloudFormation Resources](./readme-img/build-app-7.png) 

Let's make a change from the "To-Do App" to the "AWS Events App".


## Step 3 â€“ Update: Add GitHub Actions.
You can use a GitHub Action alongside native CodeCatalyst actions in a CodeCatalyst workflow, that allow to add any github action from the [marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions). Let's add 
[Super-Linter GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter) for our application. 
1. In the navigation pane, expand CI/CD and choose **Workflows**. Select your workflow and click **Edit** button at the top.
2. The linter can be add on yaml and visual mode. 
	1. Visual mode:
	2. ![Visual mode step one](./readme-img/githubactions-01.png)
	3. ![Visual mode step two](./readme-img/githubactions-02.png)
3. Let's do the same but use *YAML*. Edit workflow and add the block: 
```yaml
  SuperLinterAction:
    Identifier: aws/github-actions-runner@v1
    Inputs:
      Sources:
        - WorkflowSource 
    Configuration:
      Steps:
        - name: Lint Code Base
          uses: github/super-linter@v4
          env:
            VALIDATE_ALL_CODEBASE: "true"
            DEFAULT_BRANCH: main
```
![YAML mode](./readme-img/githubactions-03.png)

4. Click **Validate** and **Commit** to push our changes. And after we see that the build is failed, linter found what we can impove in our code  

![Linter result](readme-img/githubactions-04.png)
5. We will update linter to scan only changes (new files). To achieve that, change the value of the parameter *VALIDATE_ALL_CODEBASE* to `false`. 
6. Edit workflow and change the value. Commit changes. 

![Change value](./readme-img/githubactions-05.png)
7. This time you will see that linter is green and our build has been successfully completed. 

![Linter green](readme-img/githubactions-06.png)


## Step 4 - Deploy: Creating issues and launching Dev Environment.

1. Optional step: Invite a team member. In the navigation pane, choose **Project settings**, then select **Members** Tab. Click **Invite** button. Enter email address in the popup and click **Invite**.
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Issues**. Click **Create issue**. Provide required information and click **Create issue**.
![Create issue](./readme-img/build-app-8.png) 
3. Now let's address this issue. In the navigation pane, choose **Code**, then select **Dev Environments**. Click **Create Dev Environment**.
![Dev Environments](./readme-img/build-app-9.png) 
4. Select **AWS Cloud9 (in browser)**. Complete all the fields as on the screenshot below and click **Create**
![Cloud-9 Launch](./readme-img/build-app-10.png) 
5. In your Cloud9 IDE, expand *frontend* folder and update *App.tsx* file and make 2 updates change 1) "To-Do List" to "AWS Events" and 2) "Add To-Do Item" to "Add a new event"
![Cloud-9 App TSX](./readme-img/build-app-11.png)
6. Update file *index.html" to and replace "To-Do App" with "AWS Events App".
![Cloud-9 Index html](./readme-img/build-app-12.png)
7. Save changes. Click **Commit**, **Push**.
![Cloud-9 Commit](./readme-img/build-app-13.png)
8. In the navigation pane, choose **Source Repositaties**. Review recent commits. Click **Actions** and select **Create pull request**.
![Pull Request](./readme-img/build-app-14.png)
9. In the navigation pane, choose **Pull requests**. Review changes. Select *main* as Destination branch and click **Create** at the bottom.
![Pull Changes](./readme-img/build-app-15.png)
10. Click **Merge** button at the top. Keep default options and click **Merge**.
![Merge](./readme-img/build-app-17.png)
10. Validate that once Merge is initiated with *main*, CI/CD workflow starts running.
![CI/CD](./readme-img/build-app-18.png)
11. Check changes in the To-Do App.
![App Changes](./readme-img/build-app-19.png)

## Step 5 - Add  Compute for CI/CD .

CodeCatalyst offers the following compute types:
-   Amazon EC2    
-   AWS Lambda
By default, workflow actions use theÂ `Linux.x86-64.Large`Â on-demand fleet with an Amazon EC2 compute type. 
Let's add provisioned fleet compute and assing it for our workflows. 
1. In the navigation pane, expand CI/CD area and choose **Compute**. Click **Create provisioned fleet**

![Go to compute](./readme-img/compute-01.png)
2. Define the name of the provisioned fleet, operating system, machine type, capacity and scalling mode and click **Create**.

![Provisioned fleet](./readme-img/compute-02.png)
3. As soon the fleet's status will be in `Active` mode, we can use it in our workflows. 

![Fleet is active](./readme-img/compute-03.png)
4. In the navigation pane, expand CI/CD and choose **Workflows**. Select your workflow and click **Edit** button at the top. Compute can be defined [on top level](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/workflow.top.level.html#compute-reference), we will update workflow to use the compute for all actions.  
5. After *Triggers* section let's add the block. 

```yaml
Compute:
  Type: EC2
  Fleet: Fleet01	
```

![Compute section](./readme-img/compute-04.png)
6. Validate workflow and click **Commit**. Workflow will automatically run use the trigger *PUSH* 

7. To check that we use that compute we can go to logs of run any action, for example *BackendTest* 
![Backend test](./readme-img/compute-05.png)
8. Provisioned compute fleet can accelerate building process.
![Provisioned compute](./readme-img/compute-06.png)


## Step 6 â€“ Add Secret.
If we decide to download third-party dependencies from private NPM, we will need to authorize it. Let's add username as secret. 
1. In the navigation pane, expand CI/CD and choose **Secrets**, and create new secret.

 ![Secrets](./readme-img/secrets-01.png)
2. Name is *NPMUSER* value is `TestUser01`

 ![Secret Name](readme-img/secrets-02.png)
3. We can see our secret, and now the secret is ready to use on the workflow, to use the secret we should use reference ID of the secret: `${Secrets.NPMUSER}`

 ![Secret ID](readme-img/secrets-03.png)
4. To test our secret, we will add variable to the **FrontendBuildAndPackage** action. You can add variable using Visual Configuration or YAML. 

```yaml
  FrontendBuildAndPackage:
    Identifier: aws/build@v1
    DependsOn:
      - BackendCDKDeploy
    Inputs:
      Variables:                         # added
        - Name: NPMUSER                  # added
          Value: ${Secrets.NPMUSER}      # added
      Sources:
        - WorkflowSource
    Outputs:
      Artifacts:
        - Name: frontend
          Files:
            - "**/*"
    Configuration:
      Steps:
        - Run: cd frontend               
        - Run: echo $NPMUSER             # added
        - Run: npm install
```
5. Validate and Commit changes. Wait for the workflow to Complete a run untill you see Status **Succeeded**. 
6. Go back to the workflow, select **Visual** view, and click *FrontendBuildAndPackage*. On the right pane you will see **Logs**, expand *echo $NPMUSSER* 

![Output](readme-img/secrets-05.png)

7.The secret will be hidden.

  ![Secret is hidden](readme-img/secrets-04.png)


## Step 7 â€“ Review Change Tracking.
CodeCatalyst detects changes that require deployment for our application and initiates the deployment process. The process is executed using a "deploy action," which outlines the deployment details such as the target destination, the deployment method, and the implementation of a blue/green scheme, among other things. Currently, CodeCatalyst natively supports three deployment destinations: AWS CloudFormation stack, Amazon ECS, and AWS CDK. This provides several advantages, including versioning, traceability, rollbacks, monitoring, and integration with other CodeCatalyst features. Nevertheless, we have the flexibility to deploy our application using alternative deploy actions such as build, GitHub actions, AWS CodeDeploy, AWS CodeBuild, etc.

We will make a change in our application and validate that wee can trace the changes: 

1.  In the navigation pane, expand CI/CD and choose **Change tracking**.

![Deployment tracking](readme-img/deployment01.png)

2. Some changes did not affect our application. They marked as *No deployment found*. For those changes the deployment process was skipped. 

3. Click **View details** on the recently updated and deployed workflow.  Please review information about Tests and Code coverage. 

![DeploymentStatus](readme-img/deployment02.png)

4. Click on one of the tests and review details.

![Test Status](readme-img/deployment03.png)



## Step 8 â€“ Test: Review Reports.

We were able to view the high-level test results. We can access each test report or code coverage report individually on the Reports Tab. CodeCatalyst is supporting the majority of test formats and code coverage. It allows to use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to analyze the application components and identify any potential security vulnerabilities.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Reports**.

![Test Result](readme-img/testresult01.png)

2. Click on Name of a report to see details. 

![Test Report](readme-img/testresult02.png)

3. You can see code coverage if you click on the file *clover.xml*.

![Code Coverage](readme-img/testresult03.png) 

## Step 9 â€“ Create and Deploy to a new environment.


## Step  10 â€“ Monitor: Application and Infrastructure monitoring.

We are at the final stage of CI/CD operations - Monitoring. We can do two types of monitoring:

- Monitoring of CI/CD operations. We can monitor API calls for CodeCatalysts actions. These API operations are managed by AWS CloudTrail. You can read more in [CodeCatalyst Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/ipa-monitoring.html)
- Application performance monitoring focused on monitoring and analyzing applications and infrastructure that hosts them. Amazon CloudWatch Metrics and Amazon CloudWatch Logs used for for observability by default.

Let's configure application monitoring dashboard:

1. Examine API activities in the dashboard. Sign in to the API Gateway console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway.

2. Choose the name of the API. Under the selected API, choose Dashboard.

3. To display a summary of API activity over time, for Stage, choose the desired stage. Use From and To to enter the date range.

![API Gateway](readme-img/monitor-01.png) 

4. Click on API Calls, and the metric will open in Amazon CloudWatch.

5. Click **Actions** and choose *Add to dashboard*.
![API Gateway](readme-img/monitor-02.png)

6. Click on **Browse** Tab and add additional metrics that you would like to monitor.
![CloudWatch](readme-img/monitor-03.png)

7. Try different visualization types and save your graph.
![CloudWatch](readme-img/monitor-04.png)



## Cleaning up resources

1. Clean CodeCatalyst project by going to **Project settings** and click **Delete project**. In the popup window type "delete" and click **Delete Project**.
![CodeCatalyst Delete](./readme-img/clean-up-1.png)

2. Clean up deployed infrastructure:

    2.1 Sign in to the AWS Management Console with the same account that you added to your space, and then choose AWS CloudFormation. You will see "TodoAppFrontendStack" and "TodoAppBackendStack". Select first the first one, and click "Delete". Repete with the second stack.
![CLoudformation Delete](./readme-img/clean-up-2.png)

    2.2 Validate that stacks have been successfully deleted.
![Stacks Deleted](./readme-img/clean-up-3.png)



### Adding a resource to your application

This project leverage AWS CDK and therfore can easily be extended by updating AWS CDK code.

## Additional resources

See the Amazon CodeCatalyst user guide for additional information on using the features and resources of Amazon CodeCatalyst.
